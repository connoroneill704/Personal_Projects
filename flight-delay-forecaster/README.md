## General Information
Utilizes flight cancellation data from the Bureau of Transportation statistics and the National Centers for Environmental Information from the year 2019 to analyze the impact of weather on flight delays and answer the following questions: Which airports are more prone to delays greater than 15 minutes? Which airports are more prone to weather-related delays? Can we predict that a delay will be longer than 15 minutes based on a weather prediction and a given airport?


## Technologies Used
- Jupyter Notebook


## Files & Folders
- main.ipynb contains exploratory data analysis and modeling.
- Model Evaluation/ conatins the model summary, ROC curve, and a scatter plot of probability of delay vs. precipitation.
- Data Analysis/ contains a summary of the dataset, the low-dimensional projections of the dataset by different dimensionality reduction techniques, the distribution of the features at specific airports, and a bar chart of the number of delays >15 minutes at the top 10 most frequent airports in the dataset.   


## Usage
Run main.ipynb and login to Kaggle account. 


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_
